# Development-of-an-Underwater-Propulsion-System-and-Integration-into-a-Dedicated-Platform-Project
My Submarine Propulsion System Project for my B.S.c Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Ben-Gurion University
Overview
This project documents the design and manufacturing of a propulsion system for an autonomous submarine as part of the HydroCamel initiative at the Autonomous Marine Robotics Laboratory, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
The goal was to improve the propulsion system’s pressure tolerance, maintenance accessibility, weight, and cost-efficiency, while ensuring compatibility with the submarine’s modular design.

Motivation
Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are vital tools for research, defense, and industry, enabling underwater inspections, surveys, and sampling without human risk.
The propulsion system is a critical component, directly affecting maneuverability, endurance, and operational depth. The project aimed to replace obsolete, unavailable motors with a custom, high-performance, pressure-resistant, and maintainable propulsion solution.

Objectives
Design a motor housing capable of withstanding pressures up to 1000 m depth.

Ensure complete watertightness, low weight, corrosion resistance, and efficient heat dissipation.

Increase thrust output compared to the existing system.

Reduce manufacturing costs.

Ensure adaptability for different submarine positions (main thrusters, wing thrusters, directional control).
